<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>Jo Stammers s3955561 joanne.stammers@student.rmit.edu.au<br>
I’m a Victorian born Aussie Mum of 2 kids. I’m 35, in my past I have been a welder and then aspired to become a paramedic, spending 6 years volunteering for St John Ambulance I gained Cert II in emergency Medical Service First Response along with regular advanced first aid training. I began Uni studying Diploma of Health Science to work towards nursing & paramedics, however hit with health complications and other life events that all came to a halt. My favourite time waster/ therapy is editing photos or creating and sharing memes on facebook. I have been a part of ‘the meme community’ on facebook for nearly 4 years as a member and administrator of several meme groups over the 4 years. I have made some very close friends through memes, my entire social life is with these people, one of them the reason and inspiration that I am here telling you this today, I will probably mention him often, so let me introduce Jonathan (he deserves the recognition).</p>



<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I find myself interested in wanting to work in design aspect of IT, creating the perfect UX is what I aspire to achieve. I have interest in working with cloud computing as I see it as the future of computing, additionally Artificial Intelligence (AI) strikes my attention, imagining the future of AI technologies for both business and personal uses. I began considering a career in IT over the past 3 years, medical diagnoses contributed to me needing to rethink career prospects, then meeting a very intelligent and influential person Jonathan, I began learning things and realising I have the intelligence to achieve something, despite my chronic medical conditions. I began thinking about what I would like to do if I did learn, and I concluded that I would do well combining my natural ability for design with IT fundamentals to create the best UX. I recall back in early high school years doing compulsory It classes, if I recall correctly, we used JavaScript to create a website, I created a website for my local football club which I was heavily involved with at the time. It was a simple website which contained several hyper-links to different pages, including player profiles, team lists, committee page, a premiership history page etc.</p><br>
<p>When I began searching for courses, I was initially looking at UX/UI design courses, Jonathan suggested to me that I start out with basic IT, then move into specialization, that way I cover all bases. Taking that advice into consideration, I began searching for IT courses. There was 2 courses that I first looked at, 1 came with an internship with IBM, but structured so you had to attend campus in Ballarat, the other was 1 day a week on campus in Melbourne. Open Universities led me to this course through RMIT, the ease of entry and the open course structure made my decision on the spot, and all online, through one of Australia’s most reputable Technology Institutes.</p><br>
<p>The ultimate expectation I have from my studies is to be able to competently perform all basic tasks of an IT professional. To elaborate however, I have expectation that I can confidently build, or create, maintain, repair and expand a program. I believe it necessary to have competency in all aspects of IT and therefore expect that throughout the course of studying Bachelor of IT, I will gain competent knowledge in the basic understanding of all IT aspects and be able to perform basic functions on multiple platforms. Alternatively, I expect to learn more about myself, not having a great deal of expose to the ‘creator’ side of IT I still don’t know what to expect of myself! Today I’m saying I’d like to be in design side of things, in 12 months I might be heading for DevOps then in 2 years I end up down a different path like Full Stack Developer - that’s the kind of twists my life throws. So I really am approaching my studies with an open mind and follow the path of strong points and see where it leads.</p>
